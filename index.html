          effectively and efficiently
          function to fulfill the common goal to improve perioperative patient safety.An association
          for perioperative nurses will enable them to focus on educating, updating and continuing togetherness in improving perioperative patient safety across the country.Improving patient safety is an increasing priority
          for the surgical team and the hospitals since sentinel events can be catastrophic
          for patients, care givers as well as
          for the institutions.The knowledge and skill to assist the perioperative patient in moving across the perioperative continuum will enhance positive patient outcome.With health care system being dyanamic and with the advent of technology in
          surgery, we(TIPNA) must be proactive and patient oriented.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Preamble</h2>
        <p>
          The perioperative setting in any medical center is the vital department
          for surgical intervention.It runs strong on collaborative care concept.Operating room(OR) nurses are the binding factor of the team.OR nurses deal with immediate pre-operative care, intraoperative care and immediate post - operative care;
          hence these nurses are identified as perioperative nurses.Patient safety in the perioperative settings is of primary concern.An association
          for perioperative nurses will enable them to focus on educating, updating and continuing togetherness in improving perioperative patient safety across the country.Improving patient safety is an increasing priority
          for the surgical team and the hospitals since sentinel events can be catastrophic
          for patients, care givers as well as
          for the institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore an association will primarily cater to the individual rights of its members so that each one can effectively and efficiently
          function to fulfil the common goal.The Indian Perioperative Nurses Association(TIPNA) supported by its house of members aims at enabling and empowering perioperative nurses to promote the image of operating room nurses and enhance passion
          for patient centred, ethically sound nursing practice in India.
